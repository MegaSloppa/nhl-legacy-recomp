### 2026-10-27 - Brenda - Initial scaffold + career-long redesign
**Objective:** Map tools/workflow for a Be-A-Pro roguelite mod and scaffold it.
**Done:**
- Read parent repo: DEV-README, current-status, engine-settings-editor-plan, sim-engine-re-plan,
  diag_hooks.cpp, tunable_runtime.h, nhl_tunable_store.h, find_franchise_code.py,
  present_grade_compat.cpp, agent-coordination-handoff.md, codex-onboarding.md.
- Mined `docs/tunables_schema.tsv` for hit, fall, shot, BAP and human/CPU tunables.
- Wrote the mod scaffold (tunable layering, perks, career run with Hype/Notoriety/Legacy,
  league reactions, FX queue, hook stubs, panel, tools) and this doc set.
- Owner design direction 2026-10-27: run = whole BAP career; drafts between games cost
  currency; FX for crits; league should react to dominance; more meta progression; win/loss
  condition undecided (DES-1).
**Files changed:** all files under mods/legacy_rogue (new).
**Validation:** none; not compiled, not run. GitHub fork and repo creation both failed from
the agent's connected account, so nothing was pushed; delivered as a zip.
**Proven:** tunable names used in code exist in tunables_schema.tsv. Color-grade cvars are a
no-op in the rebuilt runtime (present_grade_compat.cpp), so FX use ImGui instead.
**Hypotheses / unresolved:** human/CPU tunable split may also govern AI teammates (TUN-2).
ScopedTunable only works if the consumer runs synchronously inside the hooked call.
**Next action:** owner BUILD-1..3 and RE-0; agent TUN-1, FX-1.
